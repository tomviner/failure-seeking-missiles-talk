### Interesting questions raised

## Reproducibility / non-deterministic
- Pro: consistent pass or fail
- Con: find more bugs!
- Legitimate debate


## In Conclusion


### Getting the balance right
- unittests should be fast but with adversarial data
- purely random data is too naive, makes shallow progress
- but exhaustively enumerating possibilities takes too long
- mutate too conservatively: less novel outcomes
- use the tools available like Hypothesis and AFL to find more bugs
